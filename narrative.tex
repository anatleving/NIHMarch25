\section*{Narrative}
We propose a non-invasive system for simultaneous functional imaging of neural populations deep within the mouse brain. To enhance penetration through scattering tissue, we utilize a spatial light modulator to reshape both incoming and outgoing wavefronts, correcting tissue aberrations. This approach allows us to track voltage activity indicators at high density and frame rate, with improved noise robustness.
